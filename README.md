# Space Junk

Source for the space/action/puzzle game [Space Junk](https://wediditgames.itch.io/space-junk), released by We Did It Games on March 17, 2015. No, don't feel bad if you haven't heard of it--we mostly just made the game for fun and personal satisfaction, and didn't really promote it at all.

It is probably not much use to anyone at this point, but I figured it was better to have it publicly available than just rotting on my hard drive.

## Notes

- This is only the C# source code from the Unity 5 project. None of the Unity project files, art assets, or music/sound files are included, so this is not the kind of thing where you will just be able to download it and make your own custom build. It's mostly just here for archiving purposes at this point, but you are free to do whatever you want with it. (FYI, the game is "pay what you want," so you can download the built version free of charge from the link above if you so desire.)
- This code is pretty old at this point, and it was the last time I ever wrote any C# or game code, so I can't necessarily vouch for everything here. Buyer beware!
- Unfortunately, I did not use any source control when building the game, so there is no actual code history in the repo.
- I did a lot of things by hand that could probably have been easier done in the Unity GUI, like building animated text menus. Like I said, this was mostly just a fun project for us, so I kind of just did things however was most fun (i.e. whenever possible, I generally preferred coding things up over using the Unity editor).
